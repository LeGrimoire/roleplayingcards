# RolePlayingCards

RPG spell/item/monster card generator, based on the [crobi rpg-cards](https://github.com/crobi/rpg-cards). It has been upgraded with D&D 5e in mind.

## Preview

You can find it [here](https://legrimoire.github.io/roleplayingcards/generator/generate.html).

## Status of the project

In active development, may contain bugs. I have a list of stuffs i would like to improve/add, but you can always create an issue or send me a message on Bluesky [@legrimoire.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/legrimoire.bsky.social).

## FAQ

- What browsers are supported?
  - This poject uses ES6 features like `import` and `class`, therefore it's not supported by all browsers. It works on Chrome 73+ and the list of supported browsers will be updated later. 
- What is an .rpc file ? 
  - A json which contains several decks and their settings.
- Cards are generated without icons and background colors, what's wrong?
  - Enable printing backround images in your browser print dialog.
- I can't find an icon that I've seen on [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net), where is it?
  - See the section "updating icons" below.
- The layout of the cards is broken (e.g., cards are placed outside the page), what's wrong?
  - Check your page size, card size, and cards/page settings. If you ask the generator to place 4x4 poker-sized cards on a A4 paper, they won't fit and they will overflow the page.

## Setup

- Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (can be installed as an extension in visual studio)
- Run the following commands from the root of the project:
  - `npm install`
- Run a server and access to _generator/generate.html_
  - If you are using [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can install the extension Live Server
  - Then opening the whole root folder with vscode, start the server and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5500/generator/generate.html](http://127.0.0.1:5500/generator/generate.html)

## Updating icons

Process to be updated
This project includes a copy of icons from the [game-icons](https://game-icons.net) project,
which regularly publishes new icons.
To download these new icons:

- Install [Imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php)
- Run the following commands from the root of the project:
  - `node ./resources/tools/update-icons.js [download] [tranform]`
    - png and jpeg in _resources_ will be copied to _generator/img_
    - `download` : first download all icons from game-icons.net into a zip file, then extract it and add it to the generator img directory.
    - `transform` : transfrom assets in _generator/img_ to be white on transparent background
    - You can edit _tools/icons.cfg_ to personalize paths and folder that shouldn't be transformed.
